# DNA_Classification_Project
This was my Classification and Final Project in classifying DNA sequence of people with Diabetes Mellitus Disease
## Project Title: Diabetes Mellitus DNA Classification

**Purpose:**
This project, constituting my final task, centers around the sophisticated classification of DNA sequences related to Diabetes Mellitus. The overarching goal is to unravel genetic patterns that play a pivotal role in categorizing individuals based on their susceptibility to diabetes.

**Dataset Source:**
Curated from reputable sources such as [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), the dataset comprises a rich collection of DNA sequences intricately linked to Diabetes Mellitus.

**Algorithm and Approach:**
Harnessing the power of NuSVC and XGBoost algorithms, the project integrates advanced machine learning techniques to decode the complex relationships within the genetic data. Applying NLP concepts, oversampling methodologies, and TF-IDF transformations enhances the model's capacity to discern subtle nuances in the DNA sequences.

**Methodology:**
A comprehensive methodology unfolds, involving preprocessing of genetic data, feature extraction, and model training. The incorporation of NLP concepts enriches the analysis, while oversampling techniques ensure balanced representation. TF-IDF transformation further refines the features, contributing to a more nuanced understanding of genetic markers associated with Diabetes Mellitus.

**Results:**
The classification model demonstrates a notable 94% accuracy, showcasing the project's success in extracting meaningful insights from the intricate DNA sequences. This accomplishment underscores the potential of leveraging advanced machine learning techniques for enhanced understanding and diagnosis of Diabetes Mellitus based on genetic markers.
